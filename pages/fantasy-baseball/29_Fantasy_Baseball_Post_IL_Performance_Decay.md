# 🏥 Part 2: MLB Post-IL Performance Decay & Recovery

While knowing *how long* a player will be on the Injured List is critical for roster planning (as analyzed in [Part 1: Injury Duration Analysis](/fantasy-baseball/injury-duration-analysis)), the second half of the equation is even more vital for fantasy success: **How will they perform once they return?**

Do players bounce back to their baseline immediately, or do they experience a prolonged performance decay upon activation? 

By standardizing player value across all 5 batter/pitcher scoring categories using Z-score deltas over a **28-game active window** before and after IL placement (matching **794 completed stints** between 2023 and 2026), we quantify the post-IL activation slump.

## 1. Executive Summary & Key Insights

1. **Concussion slumps are severe:** Hitters returning from a 7-day IL stay (almost exclusively concussions) suffer a massive slump, losing a median of **-1.76 standard deviations** in value. Their average OPS drops by **-0.088**.
2. **Rushed pitchers regression:** Pitchers activated from short 10-day IL stays show the worst regression (**64.5% get worse**). SP ERA rises by **+0.62** and RP ERA spikes by **+1.11**, indicating that rushing a pitcher back on a minimum stay before they are fully built up leads to immediate regression.
3. **The 15-day Pitcher tax:** Standard 15-day pitcher stays result in a steady, moderate decay (median $\Delta Z = -0.66$). Expect starting pitchers to give up an average of **+0.46 ERA** and **-2.5 Quality Starts** over their first 28 active games back.
4. **60-day IL healing benefits:** Long-term 60-day IL stays are the only tier where players return with positive value (median $\Delta Z = +2.06$ for batters). Taking the time to fully recover beats trying to play through lingering issues.

## 2. Methodology & Z-Score Delta Math

To evaluate overall performance change objectively across different categories (R, HR, RBI, SB, OPS for batters; K/9, QS, SVHD, ERA, WHIP for pitchers), we calculate a **Z-Score Delta** ($\Delta Z$):

$$\Delta Z = Z_{\text{post}} - Z_{\text{pre}}$$

* **Active Windows:** We compare the **28 active games played immediately before** IL placement against the **28 active games played immediately after** IL activation. 
* **Filter:** To eliminate sample-size noise from short call-ups or immediate re-injuries, players must have played a minimum of **10 active games** in both windows to be matched.
* **Scaling:** Daily counting stats (R, HR, RBI, SB, QS, SVHD) are scaled to a standard 28-game representation.
* **Directionality:** Signs are inverted for ERA and WHIP so that lower (better) pitching ratios yield a positive (improving) Z-score change.

## 3. Post-IL Performance Change Distributions

Below is the generated 3x2 grid of histograms showing the distribution of player Z-score changes. Green represents performance improvement, while red represents regression. The percentage of players getting better vs. worse is summarized in each chart:

### Batters: Summary of Improvement vs. Regression by IL Type

| IL Type | Stints | Worse % (< 0 Delta Z) | Better % (>= 0 Delta Z) | Median Z-Score Delta | Fantasy Outlook |
|---------|--------|------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **7-day IL** | 26 | 57.7% | 42.3% | **-1.76** | **High Risk:** Avoid starting players immediately upon return from concussion IL. |
| **10-day IL** | 517 | 49.9% | 50.1% | **+0.02** | **Neutral:** Standard stays for hitters return very close to baseline performance. |
| **60-day IL** | 4 | 50.0% | 50.0% | **+2.06** | **Buy Candidate:** Long-term recovery allows batters to return at full strength. |

### Pitchers: Summary of Improvement vs. Regression by IL Type

| IL Type | Stints | Worse % (< 0 Delta Z) | Better % (>= 0 Delta Z) | Median Z-Score Delta | Fantasy Outlook |
|---------|--------|------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **10-day IL** | 62 | 64.5% | 35.5% | **-0.67** | **Heavy Fade:** Short-stay pitchers are frequently rushed and highly volatile. |
| **15-day IL** | 183 | 56.3% | 43.7% | **-0.66** | **Moderate Fade:** Standard pitcher IL stays lead to minor ratio inflation. |
| **60-day IL** | 1 | 0.0% | 100.0% | **+4.72** | **Tiny Sample:** Rebound gains are high, but sample size is negligible. |

## 4. Performance Decay by Position and IL Length

### Batters by IL Length

Standard hitter IL stays (10-day) are remarkably stable. However, the 7-day IL represents a severe slump:

| IL Type | Stints | Avg Duration (Days) | Pre OPS | Post OPS | OPS Δ | R Δ | HR Δ | RBI Δ | SB Δ |
|---------|--------|---------------------|---------|----------|-------|-----|------|-------|------|
| **7-day IL** | 26 | 15.3 | 0.782 | 0.694 | **-0.088** | -1.1 | -1.1 | -2.1 | -0.6 |
| **10-day IL** | 517 | 21.7 | 0.718 | 0.717 | **-0.001** | -0.2 | +0.1 | -0.1 | -0.3 |
| **60-day IL** | 4 | 75.0 | 0.701 | 0.759 | **+0.057** | +0.3 | -0.4 | -0.1 | +0.8 |

### Starting Pitchers (SP) by IL Length

Starting pitchers activated from standard 15-day stays see their ERA jump by an average of **+0.46** and their 28-game Quality Starts total drop by **-2.5**:

| IL Type | Stints | Avg Duration (Days) | Pre ERA | Post ERA | ERA Δ | Pre WHIP | Post WHIP | WHIP Δ | K/9 Δ | QS Δ |
|---------|--------|---------------------|---------|----------|-------|----------|-----------|--------|-------|------|
| **10-day IL** | 14 | 3.2 | 3.56 | 4.18 | **+0.62** | 1.21 | 1.32 | +0.12 | +0.2 | -1.9 |
| **15-day IL** | 35 | 23.3 | 4.36 | 4.82 | **+0.46** | 1.33 | 1.37 | +0.04 | -0.1 | -2.5 |
| **60-day IL** | 1 | 62.0 | 6.15 | 3.84 | **-2.32** | 1.29 | 1.20 | -0.09 | +2.7 | +5.6 |

### Relief Pitchers (RP) by IL Length

Relievers show a similar trend: 10-day activations are disastrous for ERA (+1.11), while 15-day activations result in a mild ERA increase (+0.21) alongside a drop of **-1.2 Saves/Holds** over their first 28 active appearances back:

| IL Type | Stints | Avg Duration (Days) | Pre ERA | Post ERA | ERA Δ | Pre WHIP | Post WHIP | WHIP Δ | K/9 Δ | SVHD Δ |
|---------|--------|---------------------|---------|----------|-------|----------|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| **7-day IL** | 1 | 8.0 | 3.18 | 4.80 | **+1.62** | 1.41 | 1.27 | -0.15 | +5.7 | +1.7 |
| **10-day IL** | 48 | 3.6 | 3.05 | 4.16 | **+1.11** | 1.20 | 1.27 | +0.07 | -0.4 | +0.1 |
| **15-day IL** | 148 | 27.2 | 3.96 | 4.17 | **+0.21** | 1.30 | 1.32 | +0.03 | -0.3 | -1.2 |

## 5. Performance Decay by Injury Category

Breaking down post-activation performance by specific injury types highlights the physical issues that suppress player value most heavily:

### Hitters (Key Categories)
*   **Concussions (All):** Leads to a major OPS slump (**-0.105** overall), with counting stats scaling down significantly. Avoid starting concussed hitters for at least 2–3 weeks post-activation.
*   **Knee (All):** Causes a moderate OPS drag (**-0.046**) and a significant drop in RBI production (**-1.0** RBI per 28 games).
*   **Hamstrings & Obliques (10-day):** Returnees are surprisingly stable (Hamstrings $+0.004$ OPS; Obliques $-0.012$ OPS), indicating players are generally well-rehabbed before activation.

### Starting Pitchers (Key Categories)
*   **Shoulder (15-day):** The most dangerous injury to return from. Average ERA increases by **+1.53**, WHIP goes up by **+0.30**, and K/9 drops by **-1.3**.
*   **Elbow/UCL (15-day):** Ratio inflation is moderate (ERA **+0.51**, WHIP **+0.05**), but workload drops sharply with Quality Starts down by **-3.4**.
*   **Back/Spine (15-day):** The only category where SPs return *better* (ERA **-0.51**, WHIP **-0.15**), indicating back rest is highly restorative.

## 7. Roster Strategy Rules for Fantasy Managers

1.  **Discount Returnees:** Do not plug SPs or concussed hitters back into your active lineup on day one. Bench them for their first 2–3 starts or active games to absorb the initial ratio inflation.
2.  **Fade Short-Stay Pitchers:** Be extremely cautious when buying or trading for pitchers activated exactly after 10–12 days. They are statistically the most volatile.
3.  **Hold Back-Injured Pitchers:** If a starting pitcher has a back strain, this is one of the few injuries where the rest period actually improves subsequent performance. Hold or buy low.
4.  **Value 60-Day Rebounds:** If a player has survived a 60-day IL stint and is completing a full rehab assignment, they represent a strong trade target—the long recovery timeline translates to a clean bill of health.
