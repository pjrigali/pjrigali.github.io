# 🏥 Player Injury Duration Analysis

Detailed analysis of actual player recovery time spent on the Injured List (IL) compared to their initial estimated day categories (7-day, 10-day, 15-day, 60-day IL) across 2023-2026 MLB seasons.

---

## Project Overview

Injuries have a massive impact on fantasy baseball performance and team management. By reconstructing **3,016 individual player IL stints** from MLB transaction logs between 2023 and 2026, this project evaluates actual recovery times against the minimum required stay on the IL. 

For duration statistics, we analyze **2,236 completed stints** (where players were formally activated) to prevent censored ongoing stints from biasing the averages downward. This analysis helps fantasy managers better discount injury risk and forecast return timelines.

---

## Key Findings & Executive Summary

* **IL Extension Rates**: Initial IL designations are highly optimistic. Only **38%** of hitters placed on the 10-day IL and **23%** of pitchers placed on the 15-day IL are activated on time.
* **Pitcher Severity**: Pitchers placed on the 15-day IL spend a median of **28 days** out—effectively doubling their expected minimum.
* **Positional Recovery**: Starting Pitchers (SP) placed on the 60-day IL spend a median of **102 days** on the IL.

### Estimated vs. Actual IL Durations

| Estimated IL Type | Total Placements | Completed Stints | Avg Recovery (Days) | Median Recovery (Days) | Spend Minimum (<= IL Type) | Extended (> IL Type) |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|
| **7-day IL** | 54 | 50 | 15.5 | 9 | 34.0% (17) | 66.0% (33) |
| **10-day IL** | 1,297 | 1,082 | 23.9 | 16 | 38.1% (412) | 61.9% (670) |
| **15-day IL** | 1,388 | 1,010 | 39.6 | 28 | 23.0% (232) | 77.0% (778) |
| **60-day IL** | 277 | 94 | 110.3 | 100 | 3.2% (3) | 96.8% (91) |

> [!NOTE]
> Placements on the 60-day IL are reserved for severe injuries. Because players cannot be activated before 60 days have elapsed, the minimum actual duration for completed 60-day IL stints is mathematically >= 60 days.
